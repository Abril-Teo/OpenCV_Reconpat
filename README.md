# RECONPAT
## Summarize

In this project we are going to do **Object Tracking** using *OpenCV*. Reconpat is a program for the company *"Caminos De Las Sierras"*. Which has the function of facilitating the use of the electronic toll, helping to detect the cars associated with the company through a photo. This program identifies the patent of the vehicles.


## Problematic

The problem is the constant failure to use the toll, thus producing a pile-up of cars at peak hours. Reconpat allow us to speed up this process, using patent recognition, digital recognition and comparing this patent with our datebase.

## Installation and Set Up

To install all the packages you will need run the followings commands in your terminal.

> You need *pipenv*  and  *pyenv* to install and run the proyect.

```
$ sudo pipenv install opencv-python
