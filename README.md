# RECONPAT
## Summarize

In this project we are going to do **Object Tracking** Using *OpenCV*. Reconpat is a program for the company *"Caminos De Las Sierras"*. Which has the function of facilitating the use of electronic toll, helping to detect the cars associated with the company. This program identifies the patent of the vehicles and compares them with the patents saved in the system.


## Problematic

The problem is the constant failure to use the toll, thus producing a pile-up of cars at peak hours. Reconpat allow us to speed up this process, using patent recognition, digital recognition and comparing this patent with our datebase.

## Installation and Set Up

To install all the packages you will need run the followings commands in your terminal.

> You need *pipenv*  and  *pyenv* to install and run the proyect.

```
$ sudo pipenv install opencv-python
$ pipenv install numpy
$ pipenv install pillow
$ pipenv install pytesseract
$ pipenv install scikit-image
```
To run the proyect you will have...
```
python...
```
## Usage
